    But still, you can't avoid leaving the house forever, so you decide to face the dangers outside and go for a walk in the park. Your mission: stay negative!
    
    It's okay – the concentration of the virus is pretty low here, you manage to dodge it quite easily. Maybe you get hit by a little floating virus or two – and you do get damage! – but you survive relatively unscathed. You remember that you need to buy groceries along the way, so you enter the nearest shop. It's definitely harder here to avoid inhaling the microscopic balls of death, the shop is crowded. But you manage. Okay, that wasn't so bad, you think to yourself. You're in a good mood now. Right after paying for your groceries, a friend calls you: they're at a bar nearby, why don't you come have a drink? You decide that yes, seeing friends would be great, so you go. What you didn't quite expect when you enter the bar: it's packed! You have to find your friend and on the way try to steer clear of the numerous viruses flying around. Will you stay negative ...?`,
