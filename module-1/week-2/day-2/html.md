Creator of HTML: _Tim Berners-Lee_

## Purpose of HTML

Gives **mark up** the the text, give it a meaning. It is also a **Language**.

It's main purpose it to build-up web pages.

It has the ability to link one lement to an other, allowing you to navigate a Document.
Those links are called _Hyperlink_, or _anchors_ ⚓️

Giving **meaning / purpose**, mean that we can _markup_ the content.

Web browsers will give users a particular experience based on the markup.

Nowadays most of the markup handling is standardized between browsers but they still do things a little differently.

We should not have to worry about this as it is the browsers job to treat the provided markup.

What is relevant to us is :

- Give some meaningful **semantic** markup
- Be aware that some markup can be handled differently in an other browser
- We should not have to make all browsers behave identically as this should be a concern for the Browser creators.

## So what is semantic HTML?

Writing _Semantic_ HTML is writing HTML that bear **Meaning**

Some examples of semantic tages:

- heading (`h1` - `h6`)
- `article`
- `picture`
- `aside`
- `quote`
- `ol`

Examples of non semantic tags:

- `div`
- `span`
- `img`
- `p`
